         <p>Easy to find Finding a product on the Internet is much easier than running through your local store to find the right product or size. You can order your shopping online and have it delivered to a convenient pickup point (Click and Collect) or to a Collect in Store counter.
            Cheaper products Some products are much cheaper online, as some specials are online exclusive, which means only online shoppers can access them. There are many convenient ways to browse products online and compare prices before you shop.
            Save time and energy You don’t want to waste precious time by waiting and searching the aisles during shopping rush hour, just to find what you wanted is already sold out.
            <p> This problem can be easily remedied by ordering online and having your items delivered to your nearest and most convenient pickup point.
            Freedom of choice Product options are much broader if you shop online. </p>
            <p>A particular product will be online in many more different sizes and colours compared to what you find in-store.
            High satisfaction Online shopping has become very reliable, hence the high satisfaction rating of online stores.</p>
            <p> Online shopping is intuitive and trustworthy.
            Rare products Online shopping can also be very useful for buying rare or niche products.</p>
             For example that limited edition sneakers you really wanted or the yoga mat that’s only available overseas.
            Privacy When you shop in-store everybody sees what you buy. In some cases this might be problematic or even embarrassing. With online shopping, you always get the desired privacy and anonymity.
